                    In this project, my team and I built a 5-year campaign for a simulated higher-education organization based around forecasts from time-series modeling. 
                    This was done as a submission to 
                    <a href="https://www.aprahome.org/Events/Prospect-Development-2024/Data-Science-Now/The-Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apra's 2024 Data Science Challenge</a>
                    , a yearly competition hosted by 
                    <a href="https://www.aprahome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apra</a>
                     for analytics professionals working in the non-profit and higher education sectors. 
                     Our project was selected as a featured presentation at Apra's national 2024 Prospect Development Conference.

                    Working with my team at Saint Louis University, I handled data cleaning, conducted exploratory data analysis, 
                    contributed to the time series model, and created/verified the donor pyramid. I also handled creative direction, 
                    establishing the visual identity of the project with graphics and logos created using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

                    This project was done using a combination of Python, R, Tableau, and Excel.
